# Landhaus-Bruckmann Frontend

An example template for the new frontend design of the company website. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites & Installing

Install the dependencies:

```
type "npm install" in your preferred terminal.
```

To get the development env running enter:

```
gulp dev
```
Starts the development server.
Watch for changes in the index.html file, stylesheets and javascript files. When changes were made, the files in app/temp/* are automatically updated and inserted directly into the browser without reloading the website.
