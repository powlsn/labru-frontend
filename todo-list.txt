      like jquery file upload but lightweight and selfwritten.
  opentime:
    - CRUD on admin
  kontakt:
    - support messages framework, and logging
    - send msg via ajax & json response

    rewrite the main app to support the new conzept of the page

    rewrite kontakt
5. integration: logging, messages framework, image (for the future more usability to write)
